!! DON'T RUN ANY OF THESE ON YOUR OWN PC OR ANYONE ELSES !!

These scripts are made just to mess around with in a virtual machine.
Running any of these can have consequences, such as: Deletion of files, overloading the PC and disabling the mouse and potentially making your pc unusable, as some of them copy themselves to the startup programs.
I'm not respinsible if anything happens. It's completely legal to mess around with them, as long as they stay on your own computer or in a VM.
Running these scripts on someone else's computer can get you in trouble.

Read the scripts carefully to understand what they do and experiment with them. Feel free to add anything you want and make it your own.


What do the scripts do?

clearall: deletes all files from the person who is currently logged in on the PC.
DeleteFiles&CrashPC: Disables mouse input (only after reboot), Deletes Documents, Desktop and Downloads and puts itself in the startup programs.
duplicateSelf: Duplicates itself and puts itself in the startup programs.
openvideo: Opens NyanCat on YouTube every 10 seconds and reopens itself afterwards
